# 👋 Hi, I'm Ayush Kumar (maryu0)

I'm a **Computer Science undergraduate** (B.Tech CSE, CGPA: 9.16) who enjoys building **full-stack MERN applications** and **AI-powered tools** that actually solve problems, not just pass tutorials.  

Right now I'm focused on:
- Shipping **production-like web apps** with proper auth, payments, and analytics.
- Integrating **LLMs and Computer Vision** into real workflows (finance, agri, debugging).
- Leveling up system design, DevOps, and DSA for serious backend / SWE roles.
